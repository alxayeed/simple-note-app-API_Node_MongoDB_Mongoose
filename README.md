# A simple note app API
This simple app is my introduction to REST API that facilitates major REST requests like GET,POST,PUT,DELETE
Backend of this app is build by Nodejs ,which is also my first step towards NodeJs and ExpressJS
I have used MongoDB as the database and mongoose as a ODM aka Object Document mapping

there are bunch of new things for me to learn

# and I love learning it!
